            <p>Since fall 2020, I’ve been volunteering my time on UW Blueprint, a club aiming to make technology accessible to community non-profits without the funding. Each term I’ve got to work on a project team with other students, and each project team works with a non-profit with a need to help build them a solution and equip them with the tools they need.</p>
            <p>My first term on UW Blueprint in fall 2020, I was placed on a project that was building the <span style="color: #FFAC8C; font-weight: 600;">Region of Waterloo Paramedic Services</span> (ROWPS) a platform to better manage patient triage and track patients + event information in real time. It was essentially a structured system for knowledge management that would be able to be viewed, maintained, and updated by all relevant users. </p>

        <p>Getting onboarded</p>
        <h2>What is this platform being built?</h2>
        <p>A platform allowing the ROWPS to better triage patients, track locations, and obtain patient status while providing paramedic services during a mass-casualty event.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Where did I pick up from? What still needed to be done?</h2>
        <p>In terms of design, the design system had been created and the main hi-fidelity designs and flows were designed out. However, several key features and functionalites had yet to be designed--which is where I came in!</p>
        <p>Besides the redesigns I mention further down, <strong>some of the functionalities that still needed to be completed included...</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete & restore patient</li>
            <li>Maps</li>
            <li>Offline handling</li>
            <li>Real time updates</li>
            <li>Error & edge cases</li>
            <li>Login, unauth, & branding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While I’m not going to go into the details of design decisions made for these functionalities, feel free to connect to hear more! <strong>For this case study, I really want to focus on the major design changes & decisions made to the existing application as a result of usability testing.</strong></p>

            <h6>Usability testing</h6>
            <p>Usability testing with the ROWPS was a super cool experience! My blueprint team got on a google meets call with them and ran through common scenarios a user would need to do. <strong>The twist?</strong> We were able to witness them testing it in a <strong>simulated paramedics mass casualty event scenario</strong>! The paramedics had even set up stations around the room, complete with fake patients they would be helping, and several of them using the platform together in different “collision points”.</p>

            <ul>

            <p>The use of two pages was then tried. After the user clicks “CONTINUE TO TRANSPORT”, a new page would be opened with the transport information, with the ability to navigate back and forth between pages to edit patient information.</p>

            <p>The flow was then revamped by changing the add resource part to the flow. Many different ways were explored, as shown below. All of these explorations would open a mage page that allows the user to edit the existing resources and make them active/inactive to edit the resources shown in the multi-select list, and another option existed to completely add a new resource.</p>

            <h6>User flow iteration #4: Final iteration</h6>
            <p>The final iteration moved away from giving full access to resource management, but just allowed users to select from a dropdown of the hospitals that were active, or to add a new one if they really needed to. Adding a new resource is the last option on the list, as we want to discourage adding a new resource on the fly.</p>

        <h2>Add New Event & Collision Point</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="section" style="padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
            <h6>Old flow</h6>
            <p>The existing user flow was as follows below. However as mentioned above, from usability testing it was concluded that the use of maps functionality within the entire platform could be improved by incorporating maps better within the creation of events and collision points. This is because it would allow the user to add pins to certain locations right during creation, <strong>instead of having to exit and take the extra step to navigate or remember to navigate</strong> to the maps section of the application to add a pin.<br> At this point of the project, the product team also got new information from the developers about technical feisability and limiations.</p>

        <div class="section" style="padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
            <h6>Iteration #1</h6>
            <p>As it was important to attempt to repurpose as much of the existing platform as possible (for the developers but also for the user experience, as it is helpful to keep pre-existing and familiar patterns), the first iteration tried repurposing the old Add New Event screen.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h6>Iteration #2</h6>
            <p>As we liked the live map experience on the right, another approach taken was to then refactor the first page, Add New Event, to fit the map experience as well. To keep the user from being overwhelmed, we broke the first page into general information and then got the user to take another step in adding a new event.</p>

            <h6>Final iteration</h6>

            <ul>
                <li>Work with the right screen sizes!!! The original screens used iPad Pro frames, but it turns out the paramedics would be using a much smaller iPad screen size. As the developers really needed pixel measurements for implementation, I had to figure out work arounds, and spend time resizing key screens</li>
                <li>Designing on a smaller iPad screen size! The keyboard takes up around of the screen real estate when the iPad is used horizontally (which was the case here), and that definately presented challenges. It’s important to always consider interactions, and not just visual design</li>
                <li>Usability testing with the actual paramedics who would be using the app! It was so cool to see how the different users approached using the app, and was a great experience in iterating on the designs and continually making improvements after usability testing</li>
                <li>Error handling, offline, real time updates, which is especially important for an app like this</li>
                <li>Balance between good visual design and including all the information a user would need</li>
            </ul>
