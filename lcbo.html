                <p>Let’s catch up to speed</p>
                <h2>What is LCBOdesk?</h2>
                <p>The core concept of LCBOdesk MVP (bronze phase) is to provide users of LCBO|next products a means to streamline the way they receive help. LCBOdesk essentially consists of 2 seperate platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presented in a widget, a simple questionnaire for users of live LCBO|next products to submit concerns, feedback, and suggestions</li>
                    <li>A portal counterpart where the reports submitted through the widget are centralized in one place to allow for easy monitoring, enabling the LCBO|next team to strengthen the support provided to stakeholders in a more efficient manner</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>What are the "Bronze", "Silver", and "Gold" phases you speak of?</h2>
                <p>At LCBOnext, all of our projects are broken out into phases, and we take our projects one phase at a time.</p>
                <p>Bronze phase: MVP</p>
                <p>Silver phase: Focus on improving the MVP and adding enhancements, additional functionality</p>
                <p>Gold phase: Final product, completely flushed out and all functionality & channels completed</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Where did I pick up from? What still needed to be done?</h2>
                <p>The MVP (bronze phase) as mentioned above had been almost completely designed for, with only a few small changes and screens left for me to design. Check out the case study on the LCBO|next website <a href="https://www.lcbonext.com/copy-of-inline-spotlight" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3a3a3a;">here</a> to see in further detail what the state of the designs were, before I joined.</p>
                <p>With Fall 2021, it was now up to my team to figure out where we wanted to take the product; what enhancements/functionality we wanted for the silver & gold phases of the product.</p>

                <h2>Noticing an additional user need for a different use case, that LCBOdesk could help with</h2>
                <br>
                <p>One big part of my team’s term at LCBO|next was the <strong>UAT (user acceptance testing) testing cycles regularly done at the lab for live products</strong>. This process was quite time consuming, disorganized, and not as efficient as it could have been and was sometimes frustrating for all parties involved for a variety of reasons. With LCBOdesk’s ability to recieve reports into a portal, I realized that this product could be a great solution to help ease many of the pain points faced by key business stakeholders who test the new changes to live platforms, as well as the pain points of our team in dealing with many defect reports and communicating with multiple teams.</p>

            <br>
            <p>While the idea went noticed based on personal experience partaking in UAT testing cycles at the lab, it was still important to conduct user research to gain further perspective on pain points. </p>

                <h6>Users</h6>
                <p><strong>UAT Testers:</strong> Key users from the business side of LCBO who help us with diligent testing of the enhancements and changes they request, for the products we build for them. They are avid users of the products our team builds, and provide constant feedback and improvement ideas for us to make the products better and better for their changing needs.</p>

                <h6>User research</h6>
                <p>I conducted 3 user interviews with both UAT testers and LCBO|next team members. A series of structured questions were asked to gain information on their background, learn about the problem space, and any thoughts they might have in regards to the solution space. Notes were taken during the interview as questions were asked.</p>

                <h6>Uncovering patterns from user research</h6>
                <p>After the interviews, key points were drawn from each of the user interview notes and were organized through affinity mapping to discover groups and themes based on relationships. They were sorted into categories, and each point was also classified as a thought, feeling, action, or something said.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, the key insights from the user interviews were summarized even further.</p>

                <p>All the learnings from the user interviews and affinity mapping were then consolidating into 2 user personas for the main users of the LCBOdesk Gold platform; one for the UAT testers, and one for the LCBO|next PM.</p>
                <p>Problem statements were also crafted for each persona, take a read at them below!</p>

            <div class="section">
                <p>It was clear that the UAT tester and PM personas face quite different challenges during the UAT testing process, with the UAT testers mainly facing issues around <strong>defect reporting and explaining/viewing status of defects</strong>, while PMs struggle more with <strong>communication and organization between teams, as well as term to term handoff</strong>.</p>

                <h6>Consolidating the journey</h6>
                <p>Before moving onto ideation, a journey map for the tester was crafted as a means to dive into detail on the current journey of a UAT tester, as it was much more complex ompared to the PM journey. This was a great opportunity to be able to visual see the journey and the pain points come up in the journey, as well as have the space to list the channels and motivations within each phase of the journey. This was helpful for to look back onto when further along in designing LCBOdesk gold, in seeing how the journey would change compared to the current process or how it might fit in.</p>

                    <td>Through showing status of each defect and having the ability to keep track of which defects are being attended to, handoff/onboarding process will be easier for next team to see what types of defects are left to be submitted</td>

            <br><br>
            <p>At this point, we had a strong idea of how we were to use the concept of LCBOdesk bronze & silver, to address these new problems. We were ready to solidify the concept of LCBOdesk gold and consolidate (from a product standpoint) what we wanted to build to address the problems and challenges we've discovered</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Part #2: Expanding the LCBOdesk Admin Portal to also manage the UAT defect reports that come in</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>Essentially, with LCBOdesk gold we want to improve the feedback cycle between our lab and UAT testers, through enabling UAT testers from business to be able to <strong>submit and track progress of defect reports & enhancements systematically</strong>, through a web portal. This will provide structure to how they submit defects they find, convenience in all UAT related information on the portal, and increased transparency of timelines and defects being fixed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>UAT testers may be able to report defects, add photos, notes, markup screens right through the platform. They may also be able to see the links, status of defect fixes, etc. right on the platform itself.</li>
                    <li>On the LCBOdesk admin portal side, the bronze feature widget reports would still be able to be collected, however there would be a new section for UAT testing as well.</li>

            <br>
            <p>In beginning to wireframe and build out the product vision, many important design decisions were considered and made. Take a look at some of them below!</p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="section" style="padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <h6>Design decision #1: Seperating reports by project (UAT Tester View)</h6>
                <p>4 different options were explored, in regards of how to visually show and group all the claims that come in from LCBO|next projects were created. This final option of a preliminary page of projects then clicking into each project to view tickets was chosen, because it was the least likely to overwhelm the users with all possible tickets submitted, and the less hassle in not needing to apply filters or scroll to the project they want.</p>

                <h6>Design decision #2: Active/inactive projects (Admin View)</h6>
                <p>With the decision to organize claims through needing to select the project first, it was important to consider how projects would be shown on the preliminary page. It was decided to have an active/inactive status on each project, to inform users and provide full transparency of which projects the lab is currently working on. It also makes it easier to find projects that need testing as well, preventing the situation of having to scroll through a list of inactive projects!</p>

                <p>The status on each ticket is a really big part of solving challenges faced by both users, and it was really important to take extra care in defining the interaction that occurs when changing a status, especially as it would alert others. To provide transparency and to let others know why the status is changed or to note down any thoughts, the opportunity is provided upon change to note down any important comments. Not only is this an informative way to provide thorough context and updates to teammembers, but this is also a familar pattern seen in other platforms created by LCBO|next as well.</p>

                <h6>Conducting usability testing</h6>
                <p>After creating the hi-fidelity wireframes, I wanted to get feedback from potential users. I conducted usability testing with 4 interviewees; 2 of which for UAT testers, and 2 for LCBO|next team members.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/lcbo-testing-1.png" style="max-width:75%; height:auto;">
                <br><br>
                <p>After that, it was time to prototype and seperate the prototype into the series of tasks I wanted each type of tester to attempt during the testing session. 5 tasks for each type of user were prepared, and during the session many valuable observations and insights were uncovered, such as from the questions asked.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Overall, usability testing was quite successful and was actually the last deliverable I was able to complete before the term came to a close. There were alot of insights from testing and changes to be made, however I wasn’t able to be the one to complete the changes since the term closed off quite quickly. This will be a task for the next designer coming onto the lab, should they choose to implement the changes from testing insights given!</p>

                <h6>Key Learnings</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing product and design documentation; I wrote an addendum and all the user interview/testing documentation on my own, which was interesting!</li>
                    <li>Breaking up design work into bronze, silver and gold phases. I’ve worked with MVP and MVP enhancement phases before, but never structured like this!</li>
                    <li>Keeping version history was another key learning and very important to the longevity of the project, especially as multiple designers have and will continue to touch this project.</li>
